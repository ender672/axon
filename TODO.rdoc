= TODO
  * have a setting where decode / encode warnings will result in exceptions

  * Test scalers with images that lie about width & height. Never trust
    Image#width or Image#height -- instead always go by scanline size and how
    many times #each_scanline calls yield

  * add #initialize_copy

  * Check frozen status on setters, etc.
  * Check frozen status (and freeze) on all VALUEs that we stash for later use
  * Check trusted status (1.9.x only)
